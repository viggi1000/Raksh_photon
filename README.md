Pneumonia has been labeled as the single largest cause of child mortality for the children under five in developing countries around the world. We propose a novel method to continuously monitor parameters like Respiration Rate, Heart Rate, Blood Oxygenation (SpO2) and Body Temperature in a noninvasive and nonobtrusive manner behind the ear.   The data is streamed using WiFi/BLE to the parentâ€™s smartphone or a smart gateway device which uploads it to a server. This project also explores the opportunities for presenting patient vital signs from such a device to the remote health care workers and doctors.  The device also enables doctors to track if medication is effective by seeing changes in the various physiological parameters. This will enable health workers in rural areas that are extremely understaffed to assist more children. The device would also have alarm modes to alert parents to sudden onset of fever or difficulty breathing.
